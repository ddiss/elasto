hostcheck
---------

This directory contains external sources to perform hostname validation
against server certificates:
- openssl_hostname_validation from
  https://github.com/iSECPartners/ssl-conservatory
- hostcheck from the cURL project, which adds wildcard hostname matching
- libevent_https_client which was obtained from the libevent
  https-client source https://github.com/libevent/libevent. This is a
  thin wrapper around openssl_hostname_validation and hostcheck, to
  setup the verification callbacks.

According to https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Hostname_validation,
OpenSSL 1.1.0 will provide built-in functionality to handle this, but
until it's widely available the cURL and ssl-conservatory source here
can be utilized.
